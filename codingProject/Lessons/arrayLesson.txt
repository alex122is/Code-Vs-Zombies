Arrays

**
    Arrays are the way you declare and store multiple items in one variable
    as opposed to separately declaring them one at a time. To declare an
    array, you usually define it with square brackets [ ]:
**
					numbers[ ] = {1,2,3,4,5}
**
    Here we have created an array that holds the numbers 1 to 5. We can also
    do this for any variable type like strings.
**
					birds[ ] = {"duck", "goose", "raven", "eagle"}
					
**
    To access an item in the array, you first need to know that the items in
    the array are referenced starting at 0. Lets say we have an array like:
**
					numbers[ ] = {1,2,3,4,5}
**
	The positions or index of each item of the list, starting from 1 is 1 = 0,
	2 = 1, 3 = 2, 4 = 3, and 5 = 4. Thus, the position of a particular element
	in an array is n - 1, where n is the length of your array. So if you wanted 
	to access the number 3, you would get the item by writing:
**
					numbers[2]

**
    Next, if you want to change the value of an element in an array, you would
    just write the following if you had the following array:
**
					words[ ] = {"hello", "why", "okay"}
					words[1] = "yes"
**
    We went ahead and got the word at index 1 of the array which is the word
    "why" and made it equal to the word "yes"
    
**
    Finally, we will look at a way to iterate through an array. This is one
    of the many reasons why arrays are very important as it saves you from
    writing many lines that do the same thing.
**
					words[ ] = {"arrays", "are", "cool"}
					count = 0
**
					while(count < 3) {
					  print words[count]
					  count = count + 1
					}
**
    Here we have an array of words and we use a while loop that executes it's
    body while count is less than the length of the array which is 3 words. We 
    are also using the variable count to access the elements of the array. Count
    starts at 0 and gets the element at index 0 then gets the element at index 1
    and then 2. Each time it is printing the word in the array and when the while
    loop is done, it has printed all the words in the array.
