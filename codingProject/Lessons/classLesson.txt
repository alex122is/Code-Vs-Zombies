Classes

**
    Classes are used in programming as a way to create an object. They
    are like blueprints to a house or a car. A house can have attributes
    and can have functions, ex: a house can be big and can keep a 
    family cool in the summer. The following is an example of a car
    class.
**
						class Car {
						  wheels = 4
						  doors = 2
**
						  honkHorn() {
						    print "beep"
						  }
						}
**
    We have created a class called car which has the attributes wheels
    and doors. It also has a method that prints the word "beep". Let's
    now use this class to create a new car object.
    
**
    In order to create a new class, would write the following line.
**
					Car myCar = new Car()
**
    Now we have a car called myCar and we can use it to do many things. For
    example, we can call the method honkHorn() to make the car honk it's
    horn and print "beep" to the console.
**
					myCar.honkHorn()
**
    Finally, we can also access the attributes of the car and print them by
    writing the following.
**
					print "the car has" + myCar.wheels + "wheels"
**
    This will print the sentence "the car has 4 wheels"
