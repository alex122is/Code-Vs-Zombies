Loops

**
    Loops are used when you want to repeat a line or lines of code multiple
    times. There are two kinds of loops we will go over, a while loop and a 
    for loop. The following is an example of a while loop.
**
					count = 0
**
					while(count <= 5) {
						count = count + 1
					}
**
    One thing to note is the variable count. This variable is used as a
    condition check for the while loop. As long as count is less than or equal
    to 5, the block of code inside the loop will be executed. Inside the loop,
    we are adding 1 to count and eventually, the condition will be false and
    the loop will exit.

**
					count = 0;
**
					while(count < 3) {
						print "Hello"
						count = count + 1
					}
**
    Lets walk through this one so we can better understand the while loop. 
    count is initialized to the value of 0. We get to the while loop where 
    the condition count < 3 is evaluated. count is currently equal to 0 so 0 < 3 
    is true and the loop begins. We first print the word "Hello" and then we 
    add 1 to count. After that, the program goes back up to the while loop 
    condition and checks if count is still less than 3. Currently, count is 1, 
    1 < 3 is true so the body of the loop is executed again. The program prints 
    "Hello" once more and once again we add 1 to count. The loop will repeat 
    one more time because 2 < 3. When we add 1 once again to count, count will
    equal 3. The condition will be checked and because 3 < 3 is false, the loop
    will finally stop and the program will continue to the next line after the
    loop.
    
**
    Okay, that was a lot to digest but loops are very powerful and important to 
    learn. While it may seem easier to just type a line some number of times like
**
					print "Hello"
					print "Hello"
					print "Hello"
**
    to print "Hello" 3 times, but while loops are preferred when dealing with 
    blocks of code that should be repeated a bunch of times. Lets say we want 
    to print the numbers 1 to 1000 on the screen. It would not be a good idea 
    to call 1000 prints. We would have 1000 lines of code just calling print. 
    Instead, we can do the same thing in less than 7 lines.
**
					count = 1
**
					while(count <= 1000) {
						print count
						count = count + 1
					}
**
    So be sure to use while loops whenever you can!!!

Quiz Time!

**
    What will be the value of total after the following while loop?
**
					count = 0
					total = 0;
**
					while(count < 5) {
						total = total + count
						count = count + 1
					}
