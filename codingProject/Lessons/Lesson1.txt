If and if/else Statements

**
    An if statement is a conditional statement that if true, will do what
    is inside the statement. The following is an example of an if statement.
**
					if (a < 5) {
						print "hello";
					}
**
    If a is any number less than 5, then the program will print/display 
    "hello" to the console.

**
    An if statement will usually have the following format
**
					if(condition) {
						do something if true
					}
**
    where condition is what is being tested and evaluates to either true or 
    false. If the condition is true, program will run the block of code inside 
    the curly braces {}. If condition is false, the program skips the do something 
    line and continues the program.

**
    Next we will discuss if/else statements and how they are used. The following
    is the format of an if/else statement
**
					if(condition) {
						do something
					}
					else
						do something else
**
    if the first condition is true, program will do what is inside the curly braces. if
    the condition is false, it will do something else.

**
    Let's look at the following example
**
					number = 10
**
					if(number < 20) {
						print "hello world"
					}
					else
						print "programming is fun"
**
    What do you think the program will print? If you think it will print 
    "programming is fun," then you are right. The first condition is false, so 
    the program will default to print what is inside the else condition.

**
    Now lets look at one last example
**
					number = 2
**
					if(number == 1) {
						print "you are number 1!"
					}
					else if(number < 5) {
						print "I am less than five"
					}
					else
						print "I am greater than five"
**
    Don't be intimidated by the the extra else if line. All we are doing is adding
    in another condition. The program first checks the first condition of number
    being equal to 1. This is false, so the next condition is checked. Is number
    less than 5? Yes it is! The program will then print "I am less than five."
    If that condition was false, then the program would have went to the next
    line and printed "I am greater than five."

**
    If/else statements will be very helpful in this game so use them as often
    as you can!
